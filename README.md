# Listing Bot for Hypixel Skyblock Accounts
### This requires a [Hypixel API Key](https://developer.hypixel.net) **and** the skyhelper API. 
### You can get the fixed skyhelper API by DMing @realonur on discord or the unfixed one [here](https://github.com/Altpapier/SkyHelperAPI/blob/master/README.md). 

# Installation 
### `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the python packages & python 3.10 or newer is required.

Change the .env file for the bot setup and the data/emojis.json to use emojis with the bot. Leave the emojis clear if you dont want to use them. 

# How do I make a bot?
### Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new Application, enable all intents in the Bot section and create a invite link in the oAuth2 section and paste the token in the .env file. If you can't follow, watch a YouTube video [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrNloK9b1ro).

# After Bot & Installation 
### After you have pasted the bot token in the .env file and put in all the other channel, category and role IDs you can start the bot in the main.py file. 

## Have any questions?
### -> DM @knaxv9 on discord
